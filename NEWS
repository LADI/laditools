Laditools 1.0 «Lady "O"»

    This is the first stable release of LADI Tools.

    This document is an attempt to list the most relevant changes introduced
    since the latest almost-stable release candidate (was
    1.0~rc2+20100724.gitf4d4a2).

    Please note it is strongly recommended to upgrade from any previous
    version as we will NOT provide bugfix updates for oldest snaphsot taken
    from the no longer used SVN repository.

                            The Big Renaming
                            ----------------

    Apart from wladi and g15ladi, most of ladi* tools have been renamed:

     * ladicontrol -> ladi-control-center
     * ladilog     -> ladi-system-log
     * laditray    -> ladi-system-tray

    Moreover, a new component has joined the LADI Tools suite: ladi-player.
    LADI Player is a convenient, graphical VLC-style application providing an
    all-in-one control interface to start, stop and monitor JACK as well as
    the session handler. It also provides basic controls for managing studios.

                              Goodbye PyGTK!
                              --------------

    All the code was ported to GTK+ 3 and the new GObject Introspection
    mechanism.

                       Code refactoring and cleanup
                       ----------------------------

    The code has been reorganized in order to allow the use of Python objects
    by 3rd party applications.

    To start writing code using the classes provided by laditools, simply do
    the following:

       from laditools import *

                  Two-in-one solution for LADI System Tray
                  ----------------------------------------

    Formerly laditray was an implementation of GtkStatusIcon to put a nice
    right-clickable icon into the system tray to allow users access JACK
    controls easy way. It's been mostly rewritten and now it shows an
    AppIndicator icon (if the library is available, see
    http://unity.ubuntu.com/projects/appindicators/), or fall back to the
    Freedesktop.org's old-fashioned System Tray Protocol Spec-compliant icon.
