This should be enough for now :

known dependencies : 
- pygtk-2.12
- pyxml (0.8.4 is known to work, earlyier might also...)
- a recent glade and it's python bindings

python setup.py install

If you want to know about more options you might want to try either
python setup.py --help
 - or -
python setup.py --help-commands

If you're a package maintainer and need help with packaging you might want to ask on #jack or #LAD to either MarcOChapeau or nedko.
