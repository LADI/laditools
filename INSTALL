This should be enough for now :

known dependencies : 
- pygtk-2.12
- pyxml (0.8.4 is known to work, earlyier might also...)

python setup.py install

Tunas root to install of course...

If you want to know about more options you might want to try either
python setup.py --help
 - or -
python setup.py --help-commands
