Linux Audio Desktop Integration Tools

LADITools is a set of tools aiming to achieve the goals of the LADI project to 
improve desktop integration and user workflow of Linux audio system based on 
JACK and LASH. Those tools take advantage of the DBus interfaces recently added
to JACK and LASH to ease the configuration and use of those two great softwares.

You will find in this suite :
 - The laditools python module (no interest for the end users)
 - laditray : a system tray icon that allows you to start, stop and monitor
   JACK, as well as start some JACK related apps (log viewer, connections...) 
 - wmjackctl : a controller as a Window Maker dockapp. Uses the same menu as laditray
 - ladilog : a JACK, LASH and a2jmidid log viewer
 - ladiconf : a GUI to setup JACK's configuration
 - g15jackmon : a JACK monitor for g15 keyboards

Enjoy !
