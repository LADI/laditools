The python JACK dbus controller suite

This project was created to take advantage of Nedko Arnaudov's JACK Audio Connection Kit (improvements) patches, especially the dbus one. Those patches can be found here : http://sharesource.org/project/jack/

You will find in this suite :
 - The pyjackctl python module
 - jacktray : a system tray icon
 - wmjackctl : a controller as a Window Maker dockapp
 - ladilog : a JACK, LASH and a2jmidid log viewer
 - jackconf : a gui to setup jack's configuration
 - g15jackmon : a JACK monitor for g15 keyboards

Enjoy !
