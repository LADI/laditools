No release happens before that :
* jackctl_logview shouldn't have to parse the whole logfile to fill it's buffer
* dynamically render SVG to reflect jack's status (started/stopped/xrun detected mini icons in corners of the bigger jack icon)
* add icons to jack_menu
* retrieve configuration options from dbus and automatically update jackctl_conf's tabs on startup
* manage some sort of config file for custom menu items (format ideas ?)

The rest that comes eventually afterwards :
* preset management
* handling a fallback preset if the default one doesn't work (external soundcard not preset for instance switches to the internal soundcard)
