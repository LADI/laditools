* popup a window when clicking on jacktray to show detailed jack status
* Display jackconf's options in an "orderly fashion". Right now this gui is a mess.
* Dynamically render SVG to reflect jack's status (started/stopped/xrun detected mini icons in corners of the bigger jack icon)
* Add icons to jack_menu
* Add a simple wizard for initial setup. Or maybe just a prompt for initial driver selection
* Fix jacktray's behavior in case there is no initial driver selected
* Add driver selection combobox to jackconf
