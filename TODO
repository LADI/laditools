No release happens before that :
* Dynamically render SVG to reflect jack's status (started/stopped/xrun detected mini icons in corners of the bigger jack icon)
* Add icons to jack_menu
* Retrieve configuration options from dbus and automatically update jackctl_conf's tabs on startup (Partially done)
* Display those options in an "orderly fashion". Right now this gui is a mess.
* Manage some sort of config file for custom menu items (format ideas ?)

The rest that comes eventually afterwards, or rekated to jackdbus progress :
* Preset management
* Handling a fallback preset if the default one doesn't work (external soundcard not preset for instance switches to the internal soundcard)
* SpinButton need ranges to work effectively (needs Jack's support)
* Jack needs to handle enums so we can have some proper combox to choose options from.
