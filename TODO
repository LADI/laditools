Post 1.0 release issues to solve :
* popup a window when clicking on jacktray to show detailed jack status
* Display those options in an "orderly fashion". Right now this gui is a mess.
* Dynamically render SVG to reflect jack's status (started/stopped/xrun detected mini icons in corners of the bigger jack icon)
* Add icons to jack_menu
